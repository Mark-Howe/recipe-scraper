        'Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Line 2 large cookie sheets with parchment paper.',

        'In mixer bowl, with mixer on medium speed, beat egg whites and salt until soft peaks form. Beat in food coloring and almond extract. Increase speed to high and beat just until stiff (but not dry) peaks form when beaters are lifted. With rubber spatula, fold egg whites into almond mixture until blended. Batter will be just pourable and sticky.',
        'Transfer batter to pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch round tip. Holding bag about 1/2 inch above parchment, pipe 1-inch rounds spaced 1 1/2 inches apart (batter will spread). Let stand 20 minutes.',
        'Bake, one cookie sheet at a time, 18 to 19 minutes or until bubbles around bases of macarons are firm to the touch but tops are not browned. Cool on wire rack. Repeat with second cookie sheet.',
        'When cookies are cool, spread chocolate on bottoms of half of macarons, using about 1/2 teaspoon for each. Top each with another macaron, bottom side down. Let stand until chocolate hardens, about 45 minutes.',
