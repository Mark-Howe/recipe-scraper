        'Prepare the grill for indirect cooking over medium heat (ideally 350°F).',
        'In a large skillet over medium heat on the stove, melt the butter. Add 4 cups of the blueberries and 1/2 cup of the sugar and heat until the mixture is the consistency of jam, about 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from the heat. Add the remaining 4 cups berries, the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, the flour, the lemon zest and juice, and the nutmeg and stir to combine, making sure all the whole berries are evenly coated. Transfer to a grill-proof 2-quart shallow baking pan.',
        'In a large bowl sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. In a small bowl whisk together the milk, melted butter, and vanilla. Add the milk mixture to the flour and stir until until well mixed, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. There may still be some lumps. Drop the batter onto the fruit in large spoonfuls, starting in the center of the skillet and working toward the edge and leaving a 1-inch border of exposed fruit around the edge. It will seem like too little batter, but it will expand as it bakes.',
        'Brush the cooking grates clean. Bake the cobbler over indirect medium heat, with the lid closed, for 20 minutes. Carefully rotate the pan 90 degrees, being careful as the fruit mixture will be bubbling up, then continue to bake, with the lid closed, until a skewer inserted into the center of the crust comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes more.',
        'Carefully transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool for at least 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature topped with whipped cream.',
